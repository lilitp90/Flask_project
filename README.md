This is a simple book review web application. It includes 6 html files:

'base.html' - It holds the basic data that refers to all pages.
'login.html' - This handles user login functionality.
'register.html' - Here new users can create their accounts. 
'search.html' - In this page user can search for his/her desired book.
'booklist.html' - After performing the search, the page displays a list of possible matching results, if they exist in the database.
'details.html'- This html provides a detailed information about the selectd book.

Users also can leave their reviews about the book, but one user is not able to submit multiple reviews for the same book.

The web application also handles API Access.
